# Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) Independent Study
## Arba Shkreli
### Under the Guidance of Prof. Hank Yang (SEAS Computational Robotics Lab)

This repository holds the experimental results and intermittent reports
made throughout the exploration of the technologies in GPR. The initial
motivation was to explore ways in which landmine and general target
detection could be performed on robotic platforms. However, the scope
was quite large and resulted in the work continuing in the form of an
engineering thesis on a similarly-spirited albeit technically different problem
which is to be released later in 2024.

The software package used for this project is called 
[gprMax](https://www.gprmax.com/), an open-source EM wave 
propagation simulator utilizing the FDTD method with the context of landmine
detection as the primary motivator.

The `file_manipulation` folder holds some files in which either a required `.in`
file was generated in Python for gprMax to read, or output file data was processed
in some way to experiment data-merging approaches.

The `reports` folder will be more enlightening for the direction this project took.
